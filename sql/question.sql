Different character classes are characterized by different skills. Unfortunately, the skills that are uncommon for the given character\'s class are quite difficult to obtain. To avoid this limitation, there is the so-called transmigration. Transmigration is reincarnation of the character in a new creature. His soul shifts to a new body and retains part of his experience from the previous life. As a result of transmigration the new character gets all the skills of the old character and the skill levels are reduced according to the k coefficient (if the skill level was equal to x, then after transmigration it becomes equal to [kx], where [y] is the integral part of y). If some skill\'s levels are strictly less than 100, these skills are forgotten (the character does not have them any more). After that the new character also gains the skills that are specific for his class, but are new to him. The levels of those additional skills are set to 0. Thus, one can create a character with skills specific for completely different character classes via transmigrations. For example, creating a mage archer or a thief warrior is possible.

Also, the order of the letters doesn\'t matter (for example, if the pair of letters \"ab\" is forbidden, then any occurrences of substrings \"ab\" and \"ba\" are also forbidden). Also, each pair has different letters and each letter occurs in no more than one forbidden pair.Now Sergey wants to correct his sentence so that it doesn\'t contain any \"forbidden\" pairs of letters that stand next to each other. However, he is running out of time, so he decided to simply cross out some letters from the sentence. What smallest number of letters will he have to cross out? When a letter is crossed out, it is \"removed\" so that the letters to its left and right (if they existed), become neighboring. For example, if we cross out the first letter from the string \"aba\", we get the string \"ba\", and if we cross out the second letter, we get \"aa\".');

The remaining lines are common, and determine the effect of the spell.You came across the text of some spell. Spell was too long, so you cannot understand its meaning. So you want to make it as short as possible without changing the meaning.The only way to shorten a spell that you know is the removal of some spaces and line breaks. We know that when it comes to texts of spells, the spaces carry meaning only in the amplifying lines, so we should remove all spaces in other lines. Newlines also do not matter, unless any of the two separated lines is amplifying. Thus, if two consecutive lines are not amplifying, they need to be joined into one (i.e. we should concatenate the second line to the first one). Removing spaces in amplifying lines and concatenating the amplifying lines to anything is forbidden.Note that empty lines must be processed just like all the others: they must be joined to the adjacent non-amplifying lines, or preserved in the output, if they are surrounded with amplifying lines on both sides (i.e. the line above it, if there is one, is amplifying, and the line below it, if there is one, is amplifying too).For now those are the only instructions for removing unnecessary characters that you have to follow (oh yes, a newline is a character, too).The input contains the text of the spell, which should be reduced.

It closes the try-catch-block that was started last and haven\'t yet been closed. This block can be activated only via exception of type <exception_type>. When we activate this block, the screen displays the <message>. If at the given moment there is no open try-catch-block, then we can\'t use the catch operator.The exceptions can occur in the program in only one case: when we use the throw operator. The throw(<exception_type>) operator creates the exception of the given type.Let\'s suggest that as a result of using some throw operator the program created an exception of type a. In this case a try-catch-block is activated, such that this block\'s try operator was described in the program earlier than the used throw operator. Also, this block\'s catch operator was given an exception type a as a parameter and this block\'s catch operator is described later that the used throw operator. If there are several such try-catch-blocks, then the system activates the block whose catch operator occurs earlier than others. If no try-catch-block was activated, then the screen displays message \"Unhandled Exception\".To test the system, Vasya wrote a program that contains only try, catch and throw operators, one line contains no more than one operator, the whole program contains exactly one throw operator.Your task is: given a program in VPL, determine, what message will be displayed on the screen.');

The efficiency of the algorithm is the number of performed comparisons.

This phenomenon has its reasons, of course, but we are not going to speak about them. Let\'s have a look at the Soroban\'s construction.  Soroban consists of some number of rods, each rod contains five beads. We will assume that the rods are horizontal lines. One bead on each rod (the leftmost one) is divided from the others by a bar (the reckoning bar). This single bead is called go-dama and four others are ichi-damas. Each rod is responsible for representing a single digit from 0 to 9. We can obtain the value of a digit by following simple algorithm:  Set the value of a digit equal to 0.  If the go-dama is shifted to the right, add 5.  Add the number of ichi-damas shifted to the left. Thus, the upper rod on the picture shows digit 0, the middle one shows digit 2 and the lower one shows 7. We will consider the top rod to represent the last decimal digit of a number, so the picture shows number 720.Write the program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number n.');

His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression. Well, or like multiple arithmetic progressions.Polycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an, then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions, written one after the other. For example, sequence (8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 4, 7, 10, 2) can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions (8, 6, 4, 2), (1, 4, 7, 10) and (2), which are written one after another.Unfortunately, Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years (a census of the population doesn\'t occur every year, after all). For this reason, some values of ai ​​may be unknown. Such values are represented by number -1.For a given sequence a = (a1, a2, ..., an), which consists of positive integers and values ​​-1, find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a. To get a, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values ​​-1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values ai > 0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions.Let us remind you that a finite sequence c is called an arithmetic progression if the difference ci + 1 - ci of any two consecutive elements in it is constant.

The results of the collisions are determined by an n × n matrix А: there is a number on the intersection of the і-th row and j-th column that describes the result of the collision of the і-th and the j-th car:    - 1: if this pair of cars never collided.  - 1 occurs only on the main diagonal of the matrix.  0: if no car turned over during the collision.  1: if only the i-th car turned over during the collision.  2: if only the j-th car turned over during the collision.  3: if both cars turned over during the collision. Susie wants to find all the good cars. She quickly determined which cars are good. Can you cope with the task?');

For more than a thousand years people have been playing this old game on uninteresting, monotonous boards. Kalevitch decided to put an end to this tradition and to introduce a new attitude to chessboards.As before, the chessboard is a square-checkered board with the squares arranged in a 8 × 8 grid, each square is painted black or white. Kalevitch suggests that chessboards should be painted in the following manner: there should be chosen a horizontal or a vertical line of 8 squares (i.e. a row or a column), and painted black. Initially the whole chessboard is white, and it can be painted in the above described way one or more times. It is allowed to paint a square many times, but after the first time it does not change its colour any more and remains black. Kalevitch paints chessboards neatly, and it is impossible to judge by an individual square if it was painted with a vertical or a horizontal stroke.Kalevitch hopes that such chessboards will gain popularity, and he will be commissioned to paint chessboards, which will help him ensure a comfortable old age. The clients will inform him what chessboard they want to have, and the painter will paint a white chessboard meeting the client\'s requirements.It goes without saying that in such business one should economize on everything — for each commission he wants to know the minimum amount of strokes that he has to paint to fulfill the client\'s needs.

Having thoroughly measured the juice in each cup, Gerasim asked you to write a program that will determine from which cup juice was poured to which one; otherwise, the program should determine that this time the pages set the table diligently.To simplify your task we shall consider the cups to be bottomless so that the juice never overfills a cup and pours out, however much it can be. Besides, by some strange reason in a far away kingdom one can only pour to a cup or from one cup to another an integer number of milliliters of juice.');

Dot chose Transylvania as the most mysterious and unpredictable place.But to their great regret, the leave turned to be very short, so it will be enough to visit one of the three above named places.

He loaded there a huge amount of n different natural numbers from 1 to n to obtain total control over her energy.But his plan failed. The reason for this was very simple: Hexadecimal didn\'t perceive any information, apart from numbers written in binary format. This means that if a number in a decimal representation contained characters apart from 0 and 1, it was not stored in the memory. Now Megabyte wants to know, how many numbers were loaded successfully.');
